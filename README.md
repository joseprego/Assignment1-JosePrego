Assignment # 1 for Deployment Class Texas A&amp;M University

I am really looking forward to improve my Python skills including but not limited to Pandas, Numpy, sklearn and sci-kit learn.
Moreover, I want to learn how to use and leverage the different data/code deployment tools that can help me scale up my code.
I am also eagered to learn about the Cloud and discover its full potential.
Overall, this class looks very promising and based on the first experience with Professor Johnston and I can say this class is going to be AMAZING.

Whoop!
